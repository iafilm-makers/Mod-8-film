The Mod-8 Project aims to improve Super-8mm filming, and rescue old cameras with dead motors:
Use modern drives, eg stepper motors, so we can eliminate the sprocket holes. 
That saves space. Use that space to go 16:9 widescreen.
Modify and Modernise so call it Mod-8.
This is an open information and open source project.
